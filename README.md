# GPT-3.5 Chat Application

This is a simple Flask application that allows users to have conversations with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. Users can input messages, and the application sends those messages to the GPT-3.5 model, receiving responses that are then displayed in the chat interface.

## How it Works

This application uses Flask, a Python web framework, to create a web-based chat interface. Users interact with the interface, and their input messages are sent to OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model using the OpenAI API. The assistant's responses are then displayed back to the user.

The key components of this project include:

- A Flask web application for the user interface.
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for chat-based conversations.
- A simple HTML template for the chat interface.
